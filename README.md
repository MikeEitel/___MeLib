 My special adapted libraries

 I am completly aware that this seems unusal to normal practise. BUT my expirience with combining different libs has proven that it is much less time consuming to adapt libraries into a own collection.
 I keept al authors as they have been as i do not want to violate their rights. i claim none.
 Beside such terms I shortened to the libs and even odified so they play togeather.
 I use mainly ESP32 ESP8266 and some OAK boards. All with VSC.
